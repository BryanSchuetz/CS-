Counter-threat finance—efforts to reduce the flow of money that funds terrorism and organized crime—has been a key component of the international community’s struggle against terrorism since the attacks of September 11, 2001. When we think of counter-threat finance, we tend to think of international banking, sanctions, money laundering, oil smuggling, and so forth. We don’t often think of international development. But we should.
 
While early efforts in counter-threat finance succeeded in limiting terrorist groups’ access to international financial networks, these groups have fallen back on tried-and-true methods at the margins of society: mining and smuggling natural resources, informal currency exchange, extortion, criminal enterprise, and so on. By gaining control of territory and carefully designing its financial systems, the Islamic State, for example, has gained unprecedented access to financial resources. 

These areas on the margins are also spaces where development practitioners work, and if we hope to choke violent extremist groups’ access to funds, we would do well to recognize that our development interventions can play a role. In this and a following post, I discuss how development practitioners can help vulnerable people avoid inadvertently funding the very groups destabilizing their communities, focusing here on the abuse of charitable donations.

## Dangerous Generosity

One of the pillars of Islam is the injunction to give to those in need. Muslims answer this call to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Some estimates suggest that between $200 billion and $1 trillion is spent annually in zakat charitable donations alone. This figure does not include other forms of Islamic charity such as sadaqah, ditrana, kharj, or khums. A developing country such as Pakistan, for example, gives more than $2 billion annually to charity—more than 1 percent of the country’s GDP. Not surprisingly, extremist groups want in on the action.

Several aspects of charity in the Islamic world make it vulnerable to exploitation by extremists. First, the Prophet Mohammad directed his followers to give to charity discreetly, saying that the most blessed is the one who “gives in charity and hides it, such that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives….” This injunction means that charitable giving and organizations are often not exposed to public scrutiny. Unregistered charitable organizations in the Islamic world are ubiquitous. Extremist groups take further advantage of the notion in Islam that niyat, or intention, is all that matters in terms of charity. When intention is what matters, there is little motivation to verify whether donations actually find their way to people in need, or end up in the hands of extremists. 

These conditions make for an environment conducive to violent extremist groups seeking to raise funds under the guise of Islamic charitable donations. The Government of Pakistan has struggled for years to limit extremist fundraising by blacklisting suspect charities, though the problem persists.

## Building Awareness of Safe Charitable Giving

This is where development practitioners come in. We can reduce the threat of financing extremist groups by working with local communities to increase their knowledge of safe charitable giving and enlisting credible local clerics to provide guidance on Islamic teaching on giving and how to avoid fraud. With the support of such clerics and community leaders, development practitioners have already raised awareness among community members about the dangers of uninformed giving.
 
My own experience conducting safe charitable giving initiatives in Pakistan over several years tells me that most individuals—even those potentially sympathetic to extremist narratives—express shock and remorse when they learn their hard-earned money could be used to kill innocent people. The safe giving principles which I have seen work in the field are simple and borne out of knowledge of the communities in which we work:
 
*First, it is key to engage with credible local actors who can speak authoritatively about the Islamic values of charity. 

*Second, it’s often counter-productive to be proscriptive about which charities people should donate to, especially when those organizations are closely aligned with religious groups. Instead, successful activities discourage blind giving and educate beneficiaries about where their donations might go should they not exercise vigilance.
 
*Third, successful activities provide nuanced discussions about the nature of giving in Islam, including the importance of giving to those within the community and to less well-off family members—a “charity begins at home” endorsed by Islamic jurists. With religion such a visceral issue in many of the places we work, successful activities walk the fine line between being informative yet non-confrontational.
 
## Is It Working? 

While there have not been rigorous evaluations of safe charitable giving initiatives, there is some evidence that those who have been informed of safe giving principles are more vigilant when donating and are more likely to spread their newfound knowledge among friends and family (as advocates of safe giving, these newly informed community members are inherently more credible transmitters of information than foreign groups). 
  
Successful interventions have also focused on outreach to the business sector. Corporations in Pakistan donate enormous amounts of zakat annually, and efforts with local chambers of commerce have helped inform the private sector about safe charitable giving. One successful program targeted local shop owners in Pakistan’s southern Punjab region regarding charitable donation boxes. In shops across the Muslim world, one can find collection boxes for various charities. Shop owners rarely inquire about the credentials of groups placing the boxes. Safe charity initiatives in Pakistan and elsewhere have worked to educate local small businesses on the dangers of this lack of vigilance and have yielded excellent results: most shopkeepers exposed to this outreach have removed non-credentialed donation boxes and are far more careful to question those who wish to replace them. 

Such anecdotal evidence suggests that educating local communities can mitigate the exploitation of people trying to fulfill their religious obligation to help those in need. By equipping communities with the tools and knowledge they need to remain vigilant against those who would exploit their best impulses, development practitioners can interrupt the cycle of dangerous generosity.
