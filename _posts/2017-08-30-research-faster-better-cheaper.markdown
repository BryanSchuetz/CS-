[Anyone](http://google.com) who has worked in transition or stabilization environments knows the value of good research. Despite its value to the development community, good research has two qualities that significantly constrain its applicability for professionals working in unstable environments: It takes time and its expensive. Even the best research, if it comes too late, is of little use in making decisions in real time. And good research can come with price tags that are out of reach for small and medium-sized projects, particularly research conducted in places experiencing conflict and instability.

DAI has been exploring ways to address this challenge. How can we conduct good research, on short timelines, and with small budgets to inform programming approaches in transitional and stabilization environments? DAI’s Philippines ENGAGE project is currently testing a new approach to research based on collaboration between implementers, donors and local academic institutions that is promising to deliver methodologically sophisticated research, at modest costs, and on a reasonable timeline to inform CVE programming. How did they do it? Over the next few months I’ll write a few posts on this research project and its results, but today I’ll write about how the unique design of this project addresses the perennial problems of costs and timelines on research in transitional environments.

Throughout 2017, [ENGAGE](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/philippines-enhancing-governance-accountability-and-engagement-engage) partners in local government and civil society began raising concerns about the increased presence of violent extremist groups with links to the Islamic State and the influence they were exerting on youth in their communities. To better respond to the evolving dynamics of extremism in the region, the ENGAGE team saw the need for research to test prominent assumptions about the drivers of extremism to inform local responses to the crisis.

But how could this type of research be conducted on a tight budget? Small to medium sized projects often lack the capacity and technical capabilities to design and manage research. As such, these tasks are often contracted out. Local data collection firms are more affordable, but often lack methodological skills for more advanced research. International research and public opinion firms can provide these capabilities, but they come with a hefty price tag.

To conduct their extremism assessment in Mindanao, ENGAGE and CS3 took a different course. ENGAGE leveraged existing relationships with five regional universities to bring them aboard as research partners to implement the data collection while ENGAGE staff will manage the research process. On CS3’s side, the Center has invested in building an institutional capacity for research design and analysis to support DAI projects facing similar challenges. Acting as CS3’s research director, I stepped in to provide technical support by designing the research methodology, data collection tools, and sampling plan. Finally, once the data is collected, the analysis will be conducted in house by CS3 and ENGAGE. This will save costs and also make sure the research results are closely tied to ENGAGE’s programming efforts.

This approach also allowed ENGAGE to shorten the timeline significantly over a traditional research project. The fact that ENGAGE’s partner universities are located across the region meant that it cut down on the need to plan and stand up research teams at remote locations. Enumerator trainings designed by CS3 were conducted remotely at each university, reducing the need for travel. Finally, I was able to bring my experience of translating programming needs into research objectives to lead a deliberative, collaborative research design process between ENGAGE, the project’s research partners, and USAID, that reduced the typical back and forth between different stake holders that often leads to delays in finalizing research objectives.

As a result, ENGAGE will be able to design, field and analyze a representative sample of high school and university students in its project area (over 2400 respondents in total) in about three month’s time from start to finish and costing less than $15,000. ENGAGE will also have full control over the data and analysis, allowing the project to ensure that the results of the analysis are closely tied to informing the development of CVE programming approaches. In a future post we’ll share some of the results of this research as they become available, but we wanted to share first this story of making quality research affordable and within reach of projects on limited budgets.
