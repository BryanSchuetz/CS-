Anyone who has worked in transition or stabilization environments knows the value of good research. Despite its value to the development community, good research has two qualities that significantly constrain its applicability for professionals working in unstable environments: It takes time and it is expensive. Even the best research, if it comes too late, is of little use in making decisions in real time. And good research can come with price tags that are out of reach for small and medium-sized projects, particularly research conducted in places experiencing conflict and instability.

DAI has been exploring ways to address this challenge. How can we conduct good research, on short timelines, and with small budgets to inform programming approaches in transitional and stabilization environments? DAI’s [Philippines ENGAGE](https://www.usaid.gov/philippines/democracy-human-rights-and-governance/engage) project is currently testing a new approach to research based on collaboration between implementers, donors and local academic institutions that is promising to deliver methodologically sophisticated research, at modest costs, and on a reasonable timeline to inform CVE programming.

# The Approach 
Throughout 2017, ENGAGE partners in local government and civil society began raising concerns about the increased presence of violent extremist groups with links to the Islamic State and the influence they were exerting on youth in their communities. This simmering crisis was blown open by the [siege of Marawi City](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/25/asia/philippines-marawi-isis/index.html) in northern Mindanao by IS-aligned fighters this May. To better respond to the evolving dynamics of extremism in the region, the ENGAGE team saw the need for research to test prominent assumptions about the drivers of extremism to inform local responses to the crisis. 

The need for the research was clear, but how could this type of complex and sophisticated research be conducted on a tight budget? The answer, ENGAGE discovered, was a three-way partnership between ENGAGE, five regional universities in Mindanao, and DAI’s [Center for Secure and Stable States](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/fragile-states) (CS3), with each taking responsibility for essential elements of the research process. In effect, ENGAGE created a three-pole research tent, with each pole playing an essential role in holding the whole thing up.

# Three Poles of Research

The first and most important pole in the research tent is the five regional universities that took on the central role of data collection for the project. The universities were perfect for this role for several reasons. First, they are located in the target regions for the assessment which reduced costs and time associated with standing up research teams in remote locations. Second, these universities have the relationships and local knowledge that facilitated access to remote and insecure regions and greatly aided in logistical planning and execution. Third, the universities had a ready supply of enumerators in the form of students who are from the region and speak local languages and dialects, greatly facilitating data collection.

The second pole to the research tent is the ENGAGE staff who took responsibility for guiding the research planning and management. While these functions are often contracted out, ENGAGE developed new internal processes to keep the management in-house.  The biggest hurdle that had to be overcome was data management. Over 2200 surveys with over 110 distinct questions means over 240,000 distinct data points that need to be entered and stored in a usable format. ENGAGE designed a database and hired and trained a data entry team to manage the task. Finally, ENGAGE instituted data quality assurance processes to track and audit data quality throughout the data collection process.

The third pole of the tent is CS3, which provided targeted technical support in research design and analysis to ensure that the research was conducted according to the highest standards and using the latest methodologies currently in use to research violent extremism.

This approach allowed ENGAGE to save time and costs over a traditional research project. The fact that ENGAGE’s partner universities are located across the region meant that it cut down on the need to plan and stand up research teams in remote locations. The universities’ teams of enumerators were trained remotely at each university, reducing the need for travel. Because each partner was able to take responsibility for a segment of the research, there was no need to hire an outside firm to design, implement and manage the project, saving time and money. 
This approach also has other benefits beyond time and cost savings. ENGAGE is able to maintain full ownership of the research design, ensuring that the research stayed closely tied to the project’s programming priorities. For the universities, this research is an important capacity building exercise. None had ever conducted research of this scope, and they gained experience in research design, random sampling, and qualitative and quantitative interviewing that they can use on other projects. Finally, the universities will likely be key partners with ENGAGE in future Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programming. Being involved throughout the research process means the universities will be invested in the results and better positioned to propose local solutions based on the research findings. 

In the end, ENGAGE has been able to design, field and analyze a representative sample of high school and university students in its project area (over 2400 respondents in total) in about three months’ time and costing less than $15,000. I hope this collaborative model of research is helpful to others wrestling with the same problems of the costs and benefits of research. In future post I’ll share some of the results of this research as they become available, but I wanted to share first this story of making quality research affordable and within the reach of projects on limited budgets.
