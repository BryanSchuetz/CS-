![Tractor.png](/uploads/Tractor.png "Sesame land preparation in Jowhar"){:.float-left}The Somali peninsula—home to 14.32 million people—suffered a devastating drought in early 2017, leading to widespread crop failures and livestock losses that have dangerously affected the region’s food security. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 30 percent of livestock has been lost. In Somalia, losing crops and livestock means losing livelihood assets. Rural people struggling to sustain livelihoods often become more vulnerable to recruitment by extremist groups and are increasingly moving to the cities, exerting growing pressure on limited urban infrastructure.

Typically, the response to a food crisis consists of humanitarian measures such as cash transfers or commodity supplies—direct delivery designed to get resources into the hands of the beneficiaries as quickly as possible. However, the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) and Danida, Denmark's development agency, are funding a DAI-led program that brings a market lens to the challenge—in ways that may be applicable to fragile environments beyond Somalia.

The [Promoting Inclusive Markets in Somalia (PIMS)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/somalia-promoting-inclusive-markets-somalia) programme works in all three Somali regions: Somaliland, Puntland, and South Somalia. PIMS is a market development project using the making markets work for the poor approach, or M4P, combined with a cash-for-work (CfW) component to address infrastructure constraints. 

## A Complementary Nexus

An M4P approach addresses constraints within a market system, where good and services are exchanged. The market systems approach is delivered through interventions into a market system that address systemic constraints to growth, removing barriers to improve the core functions, supporting functions, and rules. The objective is to improve poor people’s participation in the market system.

M4P projects often address market systems using a value chain approach. This involves a mapping and analysis process and selecting value chains to engage in that show significant growth potential, to meet the growth agenda that underpins the market systems approach. Yet the PIMS market systems approach was not wholly focused on growth potential, rather the lens utilized for selecting value chains (ocean fisheries, sesame, and dairy) also incorporated social impact for a greater holistic growth profile and feasibility given the fragile environment. 

Creating inclusive markets is the underlying thesis behind PIMS. However, a natural fit with the inclusive market growth agenda has been the CfW component. The initial value chain growth strategies identified the binding infrastructure constraints, and the potential benefits from removing these challenges. This meant that PIMS was able to launch its value chain interventions as a foundation, and then layer a CfW workstream over the interventions as a complementary activity to enhance impact. 

## CfW as a Crisis Response

In 2016, to limit the danger that many Somalis face from drought, PIMS dramatically scaled up its CfW efforts. CfW projects, traditionally viewed as a way of providing assistance to people during emergencies, have typically paid little attention to sustainability. PIMS, by contrast, puts sustainability at the heart of its CfW programming, selecting interventions based on their sustainability, impact, and response.

We determine whether a proposed intervention a) deliver lasting infrastructure improvements that can be managed by the community; b) generate a significant economic benefit for that community; and c) provide an appropriate emergency response for the population under stress. 

With these principles in mind, the PIMS team determined that canal rehabilitation would be offer the most sustainable impact with immediate benefits for the community under duress. Although it had never been a priority, canal rehabilitation became a focal point as PIMS adapted to the deteriorating conditions. Concentrated in the Shabelle Valley of South Somalia, this CfW programming has resulted in additional land for production of sesame and other crops by improving irrigation during a vital growing season. At the same time, participants learn how to repair basic infrastructure and earn cash to compensate for their livelihood losses.

PIMS also introduced mobile money payments for the work, addressing the challenge of moving large volumes of money around in rural areas. In a traditional disaster reconstruction scenario payment is a challenge, but even more so in areas with no government control. Using a mobile payment system kept workers from being pressed to hand over physical cash and removed the danger and cost to the implementers of having to bring large sums of cash into conflict zones. 

## Creating Productive Relationships to Achieve Impact

All CfW programming was community-led in the planning stage. PIMS established community-led local management committees and provided training on sustainability, conflict management, and the proper use and management of renovated canals, so that the community could maintain its new assets after PIMS exits. As of November 2017, these assets amount to 87 kilometers of canals which have opened up more than 1,700 hectares of productive land. The community agreed canal rehabilitation was what they needed. The communities also saw the productive value the longer-term assets would generate. 

It is not by chance that the communities and local firms became engaged with the PIMS CfW activities. Following the original value chain and CfW growth strategies, communities were mapped, and relationships built along with prospective lead firms, providing partners for the community and PIMS team to engage with when the drought occurred. Having the existing relationships with the lead firms and communities was crucial.

With the CfW canal rehabilitation taking place in areas where the terrorist group Al-Shabaab had a presence, access was limited for PIMS. Therefore, presenting an economic incentive to the local firms with the value proposition was even more important, as the they were required to drive the community outreach and mobilization. With careful monitoring procedures in place, this allowed PIMS to conduct remote activities and ensure duty of care for project staff. By working through a local firm as the organizer of the CfW activities, PIMS was able to remove the donor distortion which is often associated with CfW payments to communities.

The local firms managed the activities in conjunction with the community as a win-win relationship. The firms invested to gain access to additional sesame crops from the new lands opening up as the longer-term productive asset. The community benefited from the immediate payments for the canal rehabilitation, but also through the development of a productive asset and a linkage with customers. Both parties won through the partnership agreement for future purchase of the sesame crop, providing a sustainable business model and an incentive for community farmers to continue to maintain the canals.

## PIMS CfW Achievements 

Feedback from all sides indicates the rehabilitation has contributed to substantially increased local crop yields and improved food security; a large-scale survey has just begun to complement these anecdotal reports with quantitative data. Unlike donor responses that provide services for free, PIMS’ adaptive CfW initiative will minimize market distortion and allow market development after the intervention has ended.  

The canal rehabilitation has directly generated 198,500 CfW days, with $595,500 distributed to participants through CfW days helping the community overcome the most severe impacts from the drought. Looking ahead, the project has designed three more projects that will see an additional 131 kilometers of canals rehabilitated (more than 5,000 hectares opened up)—plus 27 culverts and 26 water intake gates—entailing 140,000 workdays for participants and injecting $750,000 into the local economy through CfW earnings, contractor payments, and extension services.

The injection of liquidity provided through the initial canal projects came at a moment of critically constrained cash flow in the local economy and helped minimize price fluctuations at a time of worsening food insecurity. Delivering on the further pipeline of canal projects offers a form of “pre-insurance” as a livelihood mitigation measure, prior to any future drought. Given the increasing likelihood of a La Nina event and the associated climate variation in East Africa, such pre-emptive measures take on added importance. 

## CfW as a Broader Resilience Response

From the initial value chain growth strategies, PIMS had identified several potential other CfW activities which could be implemented in the future if circumstances dictate (such as canal rehabilitation for banana production). CfW is not a traditional method of drought response. But unlike [cash transfer programmes](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/kenya-hunger-safety-net-programme-phase-2-hsnp2), for example, it can deliver both rapid liquidity to stricken communities, on the one hand, and medium-term local revenue generation, long-term economic growth, and infrastructure assets, on the other. CfW projects therefore have broader potential in resilience programming. 

It is always problematic to generalize, but in certain fragile states economic growth has been shown to be more crucial than political reform in preventing a return to conflict. A [2014 study](https://issafrica.s3.amazonaws.com/site/uploads/Paper266.pdf) in Somalia showed that the main self-reported reason given by former Al-Shabaab member for joining the group were economic. economic. National data is scarce, but recent estimates put the unemployment rate at 47 percent overall, and [67 percent](http://www.oecd.org/dev/africa/) among young people. 

The unemployment crisis may be even worse in urban Somalia. Mogadishu, for example, had a [66 percent unemployment](http://fragilecities.igarape.org.br/) rate in 2015. In this context, it bears reiterating that recurrent drought is a key driver of migration, as seen again in Somalia this year. Somalia’s internal migration has placed significant pressure on urban centers. People who have lost their rural livelihoods are traveling to cities in search of jobs, but with limited opportunities available and a growing influx of job-seekers, these individuals may find themselves even more vulnerable, especially if they are young. To head off urban migration in times of rural uncertainty, rapid responses are needed. 

In many fragile states like Somalia, humanitarian and economic development programs are moving closer together in DFID’s thinking, and implementers should be addressing these dual objectives in ways that are mutually supportive. In reflecting on PIMS’ combination of resilience programming with a market systems methodology—the SIR framework informed by M4P analysis—we hope to be part of the debate on how CfW initiatives can tackle emergency issues while also delivering enduring benefits in terms of economic growth and social stability.
