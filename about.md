The **[Center for Secure and Stable States](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/fragile-states)** integrates DAI’s technical and operational experience in designing, delivering, and monitoring projects in fragile states with research in the fields of peace-building and political transition, countering extremism, stabilization, and security and justice. The Center engages with local partners and international counterparts in the research, diplomatic, and military communities to deliver locally driven solutions to the economic, social, and political drivers of fragility, ideally before they manifest in conflict and instability. Our programs build resilient communities, empower moderate voices, rehabilitate and reintegrate ex-combatants, build accountable justice and security sector systems, and support stable and responsive institutions.

* **Peace-Building and Political Transition**. At critical moments in a country’s transition process, we facilitate the sustainable rebuilding of communities by their own members while supporting progress toward legitimate governments that are better able to respond to the needs of their populations.

* **Countering Extremism**. Our work, ranging from alternative digital
 messaging to empowering community-led interventions, seeks to avert and address extremist rhetoric and activities across the ideological
 spectrum using a range of preventing and countering extremism tools to reach vulnerable communities.

* **Stabilization**. Working with government, civil, and private sector partners and building on our diverse experience and nuanced understanding of conflict dynamics in crisis environments, we act, assess, and adapt to
 address the root causes of instability and lay the foundation for
 sustainable peace and long-term development.

* **Security and Justice**. In complex transitional justice and post-conflict environments, we support access to, accountability in, and the stability of formal and informal justice institutions, building the capacity of legitimate security and justice systems to deliver services and ensure citizen security.
