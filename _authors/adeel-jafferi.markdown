Adeel has a specific interest in strategic communications and has created many successful communications campaigns to counter violent extremist narratives and interrupt extremist recruitment practices. He believes that programs should be designed to include stories and experiences which help to displace divisive narratives and dissolve extremist impulses, rather than theories and counter-ideologies.
