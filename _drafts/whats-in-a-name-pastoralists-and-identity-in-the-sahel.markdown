It is broadly understood that language—especially generalizing and dehumanizing language—can play a central role in fostering communal violence. [William Donohue has shown](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254116598_The_Identity_Trap_The_Language_of_Genocide) how the language of classification and dehumanization was a key early warning in the Rwandan genocide, for example. Such instances should remind development actors to be mindful of the words they use, however innocuous they may seem. Case in point: a term often used in discussion of economics and conflict in the Sahel—“pastoralist.”
